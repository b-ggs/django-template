      # pyright-python can be a little flaky when it's instructed to check
      # files directly after it's first installed on GitHub Actions runners.
      #
      # Issues on GitHub seem to assert that it may have to do with
      # pyright-python trying to perform type-checking at the same time as
      # setting up node and npm for the first time.
      #
      # This command will set up node, npm, and pyright, so when it's run by
      # pre-commit, pyright will have already been fully set up.
